# Space-Invader-Simple-Console-Game

This simple game works only on Windows as it uses the conio.h and windows.h librariesand since it was created a little while ago it may no longer work as expected when built.

This is an ultra-simplified console version of the Space Invader game made in C++ with just around 200 lines of code.
Movement is done by using the W,S,A and D keys and in order to shoot press P.

This is not meant to be a "serious" project, use it as you will.
